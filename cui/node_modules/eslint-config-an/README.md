# This package provides AN's .eslintrc as an extensible shared config.

## What is eslint shareable config?

Eslint supports sharing your own lint config to other projects, this is achieved by publishing 
your config as a normal npm package. Anyone who wants to use your config can install this package and referrent it in the *extends* field.

For more details, please see the corresponding doc on [Eslint](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs)


## Why shareable config?

* We can keep the same code style across projects in a company or a branch
* We can easily maintain code checking rules in one central place
* We can re-org codes across variant projects smoothly


## How to use?

It's quite simple. Please follow the following steps to setup your *.eslintrc* to use shareabl config:

> **1. Add package dependence in your project's *package.json* file**

For ssh auth
```javascript
"devDependencies": {
    //...
    "eslint-config-an": "git+ssh://git@gitlab.dev.activenetwork.com:ActiveNet/eslint-config-an.git",
    //...
}
```
Or, for https
```javascript
"devDependencies": {
    //...
    "eslint-config-an": "git+https://gitlab.dev.activenetwork.com:ActiveNet/eslint-config-an.git",
    //...
}
```


> **2. Install the newlly added package**

```
$ npm install
```

If there were warning say missing peer denpendencies, install them as well in devDependencies.


> **3. Reference the package in your *.eslintrc* file**

An example:

```javascript
{
  "extends": "an",
  "rules": {
    "no-param-reassign": 0,
    "no-shadow": [2, { "allow": ["headers", "body"] }]
  }
}
```

Please notice that using a short name of AN's shareable config is OK, Eslint can find it properly.

Now, your eslintrc would become simple and small. Private rules or rules to override the shared config can be defined inside it, 
but this has possibility to raise the compatible issue across projects. So, think before do it.

## I want to change or add a new rule in shareable config

If you need to change a rule's option or add a new rule in shareable config that may affect 
all the projects, please contact [jc.si@activenetwork.com](mailto:jc.si@activenetwork.com) or send code reiew request to him directly.

From long term point of view, in what ever cases, developers need to make sure all the code pass eslint locally before merging to CI branches.
